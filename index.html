  <h1>Welcome to Bekah's Page!</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I went to school for economics, political science, and East Asian studies, but ended up as an admin for a team of amazing software developers. I've been doing some requirements testing at work when I'm not doing admin things and love it, so I thought I should learn a bit of coding as well.</p> 
  <h2>Things I'm Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Command Line</li>
    <li>HMTL</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Markdown</li>
    <li>C#</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>My Blog</h2>
  <p>June 4, 2017: Changed the RAM on my Mac Mini from 4GB to 8GB. My computer didn't begin to smoke or spontaneously combust, so I'm calling this a win. Also, I can now use more than one program at a time, which is nice.</p>
  <p>June 3, 2017: Completed about 25% of the Learn HTML & CSS: Part 1 course from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. Putting what I've learned into practice on this page, so it may look a bit messy for a while.</p>
  <p>June 2, 2017: Completed the Learn the Command Line course from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. If only I'd known how to use Command Line in middle school when our teacher removed the classroom computer's mouse to prevent unauthorized computer usage.</p>
