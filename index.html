      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>At university I studied economics, political science, and East Asian studies, but ended up as an admin for a team of amazing software developers. I've been doing some requirements testing at work when I'm not doing admin things and love it, so I thought I should learn a bit of coding as well. This page is where I will practice what I'm learning and keep a record of what I've learned.</p>

      <h2>My Blog</h2>
      <p><b><u>June 7, 2017:</b></u> Completed the <i>Make a Website</i> course (3 hours) from 
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. This course covered a lot of the same things as the HTML/CSS course I finished yesterday, but it also included a section on Bootstrap. I may end up rewriting this site so I can utilize some <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/" target="_blank">Bootstrap components.</a></p>      
      
      <p><b><u>June 6, 2017:</b></u> Completed the <i>Learn HTML & CSS: Part 1</i> course (10 hours) from 
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. 
      I love this site's courses. They're easy to understand and extremely interactive. I went from knowing nothing to being able to make this site (homely as it may be) in three days. <i class="em em-smiley"></i></p>

      <p><b><u>June 4, 2017:</b></u> Changed the RAM on my Mac Mini from 4GB to 8GB. 
        My computer didn't begin to smoke or spontaneously combust, so I'm calling this a win. 
        Also, I can now use more than one program at a time, which is nice. Fun Fact: macOS Sierra uses about 2.3GB of RAM
        just to exist. Watch the video below to see me in action.</p>

      <p><b><u>June 2, 2017:</b></u> Completed the <i>Learn the Command Line</i> course (3 hours) from 
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. 
      If only I'd known how to use Command Line in middle school when our teacher removed the classroom 
      computer's mouse to prevent unauthorized computer usage.</p>

      <p><b><u>May 20, 2017:</b></u> Started the first of my courses towards a degree in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity.
        I'll also be completing courses for a minor in Information Systems Management. However, the school does 
        not allow students with previous degrees to obtain minors. The skills I'll gain from the courses are more 
        important than a line on a transcript saying it all counted as a minor anyway (I'm slightly salty). </p>

      <p><b><u>April 13 - Present:</b></u> Completed eleven of fifteen preparation courses (16 hours so far) for the CompTIA 220-902 A+ certification.
        I've gotten a bit sidetracked with reading a book on Systems Engineering and doing other courses.</p>

      <p><b><u>February 28 - April 13, 2017:</b></u> Completed three courses (6 hours) on Agile Project Management. 
        Where I work, we use a mix of Agile and Waterfall methodologies.</p>

      <p><b><u>December 14, 2016 - January 19, 2017:</b></u> Completed four courses (10 hours) on programming basics and C#. 
        I'm not going to lie - I've forgotten most everything already.</p>

      <p><b><u>December 5, 2016:</b></u> After completing nineteen preparation courses (about 22 hours) and several attempts, 
        I passed a practice exam for the CompTIA 220-901 A+ certification. It's been a good foundation since before 
        this I knew next to nothing about computers beyond everyday usage.</p>
