  <h1><u>Welcome to Bekah's Page!</u></h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>At university I studied economics, political science, and East Asian studies, but ended up as an admin for a team of amazing software developers. I've been doing some requirements testing at work when I'm not doing admin things and love it, so I thought I should learn a bit of coding as well. This page is where I will practice what I'm learning and keep a record of what I've learned.</p> 
  <h2>Things I'm Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Command Line</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Markdown</li>
    <li>C#</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>My Blog</h2>
  <p><b>June 4, 2017:</b> Changed the RAM on my Mac Mini from 4GB to 8GB. 
    My computer didn't begin to smoke or spontaneously combust, so I'm calling this a win. 
    Also, I can now use more than one program at a time, which is nice. Fun Fact: macOS Sierra uses about 2.3GB of RAM
    just to exist.</p>

  <p><b>June 3, 2017:</b> Completed about 25% of the Learn HTML & CSS: Part 1 course from 
    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. 
  Putting what I've learned into practice on this page, so it may look a bit messy for a while.</p>

  <p><b>June 2, 2017:</b> Completed the Learn the Command Line course (3 hours) from 
    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>. 
  If only I'd known how to use Command Line in middle school when our teacher removed the classroom 
  computer's mouse to prevent unauthorized computer usage.</p>

  <p><b>May 20, 2017:</b> Started the first of my courses towards a degree in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity.
    I'll also be completing courses for a minor in Information Systems Management. However, the school does 
    not allow students with previous degrees to obtain minors. The skills I'll gain from the courses are more 
    important than a line on a transcript saying it all counted as a minor anyway (I'm slightly salty). </p>

  <p><b>April 13 - Present:</b> Completed eleven of fifteen preparation courses (16 hours so far) for the CompTIA 220-902 A+ certification.
    I've gotten a bit sidetracked with reading a book on Systems Engineering and doing other courses.</p>

  <p><b>February 28 - April 13, 2017:</b> Completed three courses (6 hours) on Agile Project Management. 
    Where I work, we use a mix of Agile and Waterfall methodologies.</p>

  <p><b>December 14, 2016 - January 19, 2017:</b> Completed four courses (10 hours) on programming basics and C#. 
    I'm not going to lie - I've forgotten most everything already.</p>

  <p><b>December 5, 2016:</b> After completing nineteen preparation courses (about 22 hours) and several attempts, 
    I passed a practice exam for the CompTIA 220-901 A+ certification. It's been a good foundation since before 
    this I knew next to nothing about computers beyond everyday usage.</p>
